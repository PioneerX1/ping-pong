# _Ping Pong!_

#### _Displays Ranges with Different Outputs Depending on Divisibility of Numbers, June 9, 2017_

#### By _**Mick Sexton**_

## Description

_The webpage asks the user for a whole number(integer) greater than zero. Then, it displays the range starting from one, counting up to the user's input number (as well as a funny picture). It replaces all values on this list divisible by 3 with the word "ping", all values divisible by 5 with "pong", and all values divisible by 15 with the word "ping-pong" (over-riding just 3 or just 5). It then gives the user the option to see this list in reverse order. When user clicks on the reverse button, they see another funny picture and the reverse ordered list with the same word substitutions._
